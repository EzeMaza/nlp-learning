    "### 1. What is text vectorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Text vectorization is the process of *converting text into numerical representations* so that machine learning models and other computational algorithms can process and analyze it. By doing this, operations on sentences become more like math equations, which is something computers can do quickly, and can do well [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Many tasks that one would like to perform on textual data like text classification, clustering and search engines can be done much more efficiently with numbers rather than words. Since most algorithms operate on numerical data, vectorizing text is crucial for performing these tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Vectorization and Text Embedings\n",
    "\n",
    "Text vectorization is a much broader term that includes any method that converts text into numerical form. In this regard, **embeddings** are a *specific type* of vectorization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional vectorization methods often rely on *sparse vectors*. For example, if we have a vocabulary consisting of four words: (orange, apple, mango, banana), and we want to represent \"apple\" using one-hot encoding, a possible representation would be [0,1,0,0]. Since the vector size depends on the vocabulary size, if the vocabulary has 100,000 words, each word or document is represented by a 100,000-dimensional vector. However, most of the values in these vectors are zero, leading to inefficiencies in storage and computation (you still have to store and process all those zeroes). Additionally, as dimensionality increases, similarity calculations become less meaningful, making clustering or comparing texts based on meaning more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major limitation of these methods is that they lack **context awareness** (each word is treated independently, ignoring relationships between them). For example, \"car\" and \"automobile\" would be considered completely different, even though they have similar meanings. Likewise, traditional vectorization methods struggle with **polysemy**, where the same word has multiple meanings depending on context (e.g., \"bank\" as a financial institution vs. \"bank\" as the side of a river). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of traditional vectorization methods include **One-Hot Encoding**, **Count Vectorization**, and **TF-IDF**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text embeddings, on the other hand, represent words or sentences as dense, continuous vectors. Each dimension typically carries meaningful information, enabling the encoding of relationships between words. Lower dimensionality also helps reducing memory usage and speeds up computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of embeddings are Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText and BERT embeddings."

    "\n",
    "Unlike other text sources that may contain errors and misspellings, this dataset consists of well-formed sentences. This allows the focus to remain on text representation and modeling techniques rather than data cleaning. News articles offer rich, diverse, and formal text and they include domain-specific terminology, which is great for applying word embeddings and vectorization techniques."

    "In models like Word2Vec, the relationships between words are often lost. For example, the sentences \"John loves Mary\" and \"Mary loves John\" have very different meanings, yet their word embeddings may not capture this distinction effectively.
