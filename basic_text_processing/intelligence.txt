Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can be further described as the ability to perceive or infer information; and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.[1]

Human intelligence has long been studied across numerous disciplines. It has also been observed in the cognition of other animals.[2] Some researchers have suggested that plants exhibit forms of intelligence, though this remains controversial.[3][4][5] Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence.

The term rose to prominence during the early 1900s.[6][7] Most psychologists believe that intelligence can be divided into various domains or competencies.[8] Intellect, the human faculty of thinking and understanding, is a related narrower concept.
