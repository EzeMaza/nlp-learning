    "- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.\n",

    "Stemming and lemmatization are text preprocessing techniques that reduce word variants to one base form [1]. Even though the goal is the same, the approach is different: **stemming** merely removes common suffixes from the end of word tokens, whereas **lemmatization** ensures the output word is an existing, normalized form that can be found in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a trade-off between these two processes. Lemmatization may seem like a more robust techniqueâ€”because it is. However, the drawback is that it is more computationally intensive. **Stemming** is preferable when **speed matters** and some errors are acceptable (e.g., in large-scale text processing, quick search indexing). **Lemmatization** is better for **accuracy**, especially when dealing with tasks requiring proper word meaning (e.g., NLP models, sentiment analysis, and linguistics-heavy applications). If computational cost is not an issue, **lemmatization is usually the better choice** since it preserves the actual dictionary form of words.\n",
