    "- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences.\n",
    "- **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and\") that add little meaning.\n",
    "- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories to words.\n",

    "Stemming and lemmatization are text preprocessing techniques that reduce word variants to one base form [1]. Even though the goal is the same, the approach is different: **stemming** merely removes common suffixes from the end of word tokens, whereas **lemmatization** ensures the output word is an existing, normalized form that can be found in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a trade-off between these two processes. Lemmatization may seem like a more robust technique—because it is. However, the drawback is that it is more computationally intensive. **Stemming** is preferable when **speed matters** and some errors are acceptable (e.g., in large-scale text processing, quick search indexing). **Lemmatization** is better for **accuracy**, especially when dealing with tasks requiring proper word meaning (e.g., NLP models, sentiment analysis, and linguistics-heavy applications). If computational cost is not an issue, **lemmatization is usually the better choice** since it preserves the actual dictionary form of words.\n",

    "Natural language is highly redundant, and *a single concept can be represented in multiple ways* (e.g., run, running, ran, runs).
